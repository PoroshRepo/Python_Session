<h2>Assignment 1.0</h2>
Welcome to the first assignment. There are two rules you have to follow while writing your solutions-
<br>1. You cannot share source codes with each other. 
<br>2. While designing your solution, stick to the topics you have learnt so far during sessions, do not use advanced topics. 
(e.g. If you haven't studied numpy yet, do not introduce numpy in your solution) 
<br><br> You have two problems to solve this week, let's take a look to the problems - 
<h5>Problem 1: </h5> Input_1: [44, 6, 11, 101, 33, 7, 64, 40, 61, 178, 99, 27] <br>
Input_2: [8, 90, 21, 11, 66, 'EOT', 199, 81, 56, 17, 40, 73] <br>
The program should take 2 kinds of inputs from user, namely - Union or Intersection<br>
Design a solution, where either union or intersection of two input list is found out upon user input. <br><br>
<h5>Problem 2: </h5> Inputs:
<ul>
  <li>students = ["Peter", "Anderson", "Luke", "Chris", "Agatha"]</li>
  <li>courses = ["Machine Learning", "Data Management", "Data Mining", "VLBA", "Advanced Machine Learning", "VLBA II"]</li>
  <li>info = {1: [0,1,2], 0: [2, 3, 5], 3: [1, 2, 3], 2: [2, 4, 5], 4: [0, 4, 5]}</li>
</ul>
<br>
The key of "info" dictionary represents name of the students from "students" list and value of the dictionary represents
subjects they've taken from "courses" list. Design a solution to -<br><br>
1. Print out who took what courses<br>
2. If a student has taken both "Machine Learning" and "Advanced Machine Learning" or "VLBA" and "VLBA II", then print their
names with a message that they should change their plan. <br><br>

<h5>Deadline: </h5> 6:00 pm, Saturday 
<h5>Submission: </h5> As this is your first week, you can email me your final scripts in the following 
mail address: porosh.chowdhurey@gmail.com<br>
By next week, you should have your personal github repositories and you have to push your solution in github, 
otherwise your submission won't be considered.
