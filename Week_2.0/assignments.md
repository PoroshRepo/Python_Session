<h2>Assignment 2.0</h2>
Welcome to the second assignment. There are two rules you have to follow while writing your solutions-
<br>1. You cannot share source codes with each other. 
<br>2. While designing your solution, stick to the topics you have learnt so far during sessions, do not use advanced topics. 
(e.g. If you haven't studied numpy yet, do not introduce numpy in your solution) 
<br><br> You have two problems to solve this week, let's take a look to the problems -

<h5> Problem 1: </h5> An equation of a 3 dimensional space, z = (x+6)^2 + (y+2)^2 <br>
Write a python program to find out optimal values of x and y which minimizes the function above. Include the analysis in
your code as stated below -
<li>Introduce the "maximum number of iterations" protocol in your code. Try with the following iterations - 50, 100, 500 
and 1000.
</li>
<li>What is the most convenient value of "learning rate" for you and why?</li> 
<h6> Hint: </h6> You have to take partial derivatives of the given equation (You don't have to find them out by using python). 
Add both of the derivatives and that should be your objective function. 


<h5> Problem 2: </h5> 
You must have heard about RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and Manhattan distance. Take two lists as input from user, 
both of the lists should be of the same size. Find out the following values -
<li>Mean</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Mode</li>
<li>RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)</li>
<li>Manhattan distance</li>

Use exception handling to handle unusual situations. Structure you code using "modules and packages" concept so that one 
main script can access all the approaches efficiently and easily.

<h5>Deadline: </h5> 11:59 pm, Sunday 
<h5>Submission: </h5>  Hopefully you all have created your own github account and your OS have the latest git package installed.
You have to submit your solutions through your personal repository, otherwise your solution won't be considered. The deadline 
won't be extended as well. So, technically submitting your solutions even at 12:00 am, Monday won't help.
